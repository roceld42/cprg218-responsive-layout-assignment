## Assignment - Create A Responsive Layout

Responsive web design means creating web pages that automatically adjust to different screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless user experience. For example, on a phone, users see content displayed in a single column, while a tablet could render the same content in two columns nd a desktop in three columns.&nbsp;No matter what kind of design you practice - web, UI/UX or graphic - understanding how to create a user experience tailored to the user's device preference is important.
